# Stepwell Radio: Parth's Roadmap (Short term) üõ£Ô∏è


<!-- ### Legends for proficiency
- :sparkling_heart:: Proficient, Used in main project
- :sparkles:: Experienced, Used in side/personal project -->


## Legends


- **What**
- Basic Description
- _`Why`_


## Technical üíª

- **Flutter App:** Mobile Applications and WebApp replacing the current website (_`Flutter is a good skill to equip`_)
- **Learn Flutter:** Build a foundation for Flutter (_`To implement the first step`_)
- **Automate the boring stuff:** Poster updation, Podcast addition, Calendar invites, show reminders, upcoming shows, newsletters; automate what can be automated. _Atleast: Create a verion that can be used by non technical members_ (_`Use that time in better places`_)
    - Auto Generate "Add me to your calendar" for an input date and time
    - Auto Mail the subscribers about the upcoming radio show
    - Updation of the home page image (without any member of StepTech)
- **Migrate to GCP/AWS:**  Move from DigiOcean (_`These are industry standards`_)
    - Ton of features untouched
    - Better value for money
- **Docker and Clusters:** Containerize the project (_`To prevent *the code works on my machine*`_)
- **Discord Server:** Create a pro and simple level Discord Server for Stepwell Radio (_`Make the Non-SEAS hooked to Discord`_)
- **Discord Bot 2.0:** A robust bot, better reliability. Features can be added, but are not a priority. (_`Because the current bot goes offline and often plays some random shiz`_)
- **Analytics:**  (_`These are industry standards`_)
    - Analyse the regular listeners
    - Identify the most viewed pages
    - Reward the regular listener, increases engagement


## Non Technical üé®

- **Humans of Ahmedabad University:** Similar to Humans of Mumbai/ Humans of Ahmedabad. Need a min number of base contacts to get started. First step would be the most difficult. 
Alternatives like Humans of Universities can be explored, in case of unsatisfactory participation from the Ahmedabad University. (_`Stepwell Radio is a community radio`_)
- **SSS (Secret Students' Shows):** Not accesible to the faculties. After a certain period of regular listeners, would be limited amongst students also (_`Listeners should come back for something to the Radio`_)
    - _Senior-E-Katha_
    - _Secrets of SEAS/AmSom/SAS_
    - _Taaza Trends of AhdUni_
- **Nalanda | Drop in Audio:** For those who want to but cannot attend in-person. Imagine a in-house ClubHouse (_`Hybrid of Online-Offline must continue`_)
- **Weekly Waterhose:** Opportunities in a compact format. Similar to TechGig/YCombinator/Morning Brew, weekly format. Information is delivered quick enough that it seems like a waterhose is fired at the listener (_`Opportunities are meant to be passed on`_)
- **Merchandise:** TShirts, Notebooks, Bottles, Hoodies, Slides  (_`Swags are meant to be given away`_)
